# 1. Executive Summary

United Meme Coin (UMC) is a next-generation meme token built on the Ethereum blockchain with a focus on **fair distribution**, **transparent tokenomics**, and **long-term sustainability**.  
While inspired by meme culture, UMC is structured with real project fundamentals — including locked liquidity, vesting schedules, ecosystem reserves, and balanced allocation strategies.

UMC aims to become a **community-powered token**, backed by scalable tokenomics, exchange-ready infrastructure, and a strong focus on growth, brand building, and Tier-1 accessibility.

# 2. Vision

UMC is built on a simple, powerful idea:

**“A meme token that’s fun, fast, fair, and built to last.”**

Most meme tokens fail because they are:
- Poorly structured  
- Not transparent  
- Controlled by a few wallets  
- Lacking long-term direction  

UMC fixes this by combining:
- A robust allocation model  
- Transparent vesting  
- Locked liquidity  
- A real expansion roadmap  
- Strong marketing and ecosystem planning  

UMC is designed to evolve from a meme token into a **community-driven digital brand**.

# 3. Technology Overview

UMC is built on Ethereum using:
- **Solidity 0.8.4**
- **OpenZeppelin ERC-20 standard**
- Verified contract on Etherscan
- Fixed supply (no minting)
- No taxes, no hidden mechanics
- No blacklist or owner-controlled restrictions

### Key Features
✔ Fully transparent  
✔ No extra logic — pure ERC-20  
✔ Ownership renounce-ready  
✔ Investor-friendly design  
✔ CEX and DEX–compatible
